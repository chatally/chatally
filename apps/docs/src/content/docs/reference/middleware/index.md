ChatAlly provides a few middlewares that are common to start with and to make your life a bit easier.

- [Consent Manager](./consent-manager): We think data protection rights are important, so your chatbot should inform the user about your data processing ask for their consent. To make this easy, we provide a configurable middleware for it.
- [nlp.js](./nlpjs): We find [this open-source framework](https://github.com/axa-group/nlp.js) for natural language processing quite useful and have wrapped it in a ChatAlly middleware.

We are currently working on a few more for you to experiment with or make your life a bit easier, e.g.

- [TensorFlow](./tensorflow): A wrapper around the [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) library, that makes it easy to use your ML models to analyze requests or generate responses.
- [History](./history): This middleware allows you, to add information about the specific user's chat history to the context.

## Marketplace

We hope that our users are willing to share their middlewares with the community. As soon as we have collected a few, we will open a marketplace here, where you can find other user's middleware.

So, please [contact us](mailto:info@chatally.org), if you want to share your middleware or have an idea for more useful common middlewares.
