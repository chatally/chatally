**ChatAlly nlp.js Middleware** is a middleware wrapper around a trained nlp.js NLP module and provides a utility function to train an NLP module.

With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become much easier recently. However, it is still inherently complex. [nlp.js](https://github.com/axa-group/nlp.js) is a FOSS chatbot library provided by the Axa insurance group that can be an easy entry point.

## `trainNlp`: Create a trained NLP module

```ts
/**
 * It is best practice to provide your NLP configuration as file 'conf.json' in
 * your current working directory.
 *
 * For examples see
 * https://github.com/jesus-seijas-sp/nlpjs-examples/tree/master/01.quickstart/03.config
 *
 * @param logger [Optional] Integrate it with your ChatAlly application by
 *    passing in an application logger.
 * @param configuration [Optional] Provide a configuration object
 *    programmatically or an array of strings with path names pointing to your
 *    training corpora.
 * @returns The trained NLP module
 */
export declare function trainNlp(
  logger?: Logger,
  configuration?: Configuration | string[]
): Promise<Nlp>
```

## `nlpjsMiddleware`: Create a middleware function for an NLP module

```ts
/**
 * Create a ChatAlly middleware function for an nlp.js NLP module
 *
 * It will write the answer to the response only, if it is above the configured
 * threshold. It will not end the response.
 *
 * @param nlp The trained NLP module
 * @param options Options
 * @returns a ChatAlly middleware function
 */
export function nlpjsMiddleware(
  nlp: Nlp,
  options?: {
    /**
     * [Optional] Name for the middleware [`default="nlp.js"`]
     * NOTE: Result data from the NLP process will be put into the context under
     *    this name.
     */
    name?: string
    /**
     * [Optional] Indicates, whether an answer above the threshold should end the
     * response.
     * [`default=false`]
     */
    end?: boolean
    /**
     * [Optional] Threshold for confidence score that must be reached before
     * answering to the request, must be between 0 and 1.
     * [`default=0.8`]
     */
    threshold?: number
    /**
     * [Optional] Indicate, whether NLP should only generate an answer if there
     * is none, yet
     * [`default=false`]
     */
    onlyEmptyResponse?: boolean
  }
): Middleware<unknown>
```
