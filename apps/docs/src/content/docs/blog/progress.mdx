## Sprint 2 (CW 11, Mar 11-15)

Goal: _Identify benefits and challenges with respect to middleware candidates._

Rationale: We want to identify the best middleware candidate for our chatbot platform. This sprint will be dedicated to evaluating the benefits and challenges of different middleware candidates. 

As a left-over from last sprint, we will also publish our current state of the Deno-based WhatsApp connector (not as an NPM package, though).

- Publish WhatsApp Deno connector
  - [ ] Create package `whatsapp-deno-connector` in mono repo
  - [ ] Clean-up code
- Middleware candidates
  - [ ] Analyze [Jovo](https://jovo.tech)
  - [ ] Compare with other solutions

## Sprint 1 (CW 10, Mar 4-8)

Goal: _Publish a first alpha version of the WhatsApp connector._

Rationale: As a baseline of the CI/CD process and for all future integrations, we want to extract the existing WhatsApp connector from our chatbot prototype and publish it as an NPM package within a CI/CD pipeline.

Besides that first step, setting up the website for the documentation process and all the other infrastructure is important in this sprint.
