title: Deploy Your Application

How you will deploy your ChatAlly application depends very much on the modules that you use, specifically the servers/channels that you use to connect to your users' clients.

In this guide, we will explain an exemplary deployment of a WhatsApp Cloud chat application.

## Create the application

<Steps>

1. Follow the [Getting Started](/guides) guide to create an initial application in the directory `app`
1. In the `app` directory, install additional modules

   ```bash
     npm install @chatally/whatsapp-cloud
   ```

1. Add WhatsApp to the application (instead of the ConsoleServer)

   ```js
      // index.js
      import { Application } from '@chatally/core'
      import { nlpjsMiddleware, trainNlp } from '@chatally/nlpjs'
      import { WhatsAppCloud } from '@chatally/whatsapp-cloud'

      const app = new Application({ log: false })
      const nlp = await trainNlp(app.getLogger('nlp.js'))

      app //
        .use(new WhatsAppCloud({
          webhooks: { path: '/whatsappcloud' }
          media: { dbPath: './data/media-ids.db' },
        }))
        .use(nlpjsMiddleware(nlp))
        .listen()
   ```

   - using `webhooks.path` would allow us, to run multiple servers for webhooks within one container, e.g. if you want to add a Signal server later
   - changing `media.dbPath` from the default to a subdirectory, will allow us to map a docker volume to that location and thus persist the database

1. [Provide WhatsApp configuration](/reference/servers/whatsapp-cloud/#configuration)

</Steps>

## Create a Docker container

<Steps>

1. Create the `Dockerfile`

   ```docker
      # Use the official Node.js image from Docker Hub
      FROM node:20

      # Copy the app to the container
      WORKDIR /app
      COPY app .

      # Install app dependencies
      RUN npm install

      # Expose the port the app runs on
      EXPOSE 3000

      # Start the app
      CMD ["node", "index.js"]
   ```

   The WhatsApp Cloud server will run a webhooks endpoint at port 3000. If you reconfigure this, you will need to expose a different port here.

1. Build the image

   ```bash
      docker build --tag "chatally/whatsapp-cloud" .
   ```

1. Run the container

   We deploy our containers with docker swarm behind a [Traefik proxy](https://traefik.io/traefik/), but you are free to do however you prefer

   ```yaml
      version: "3.9"
      networks:
        bridge:
          external: true
        traefik_net:
          external: true

      services:
        app:
          image: chatally/whatsapp-cloud
          networks:
            - traefik_net
            - bridge
          volumes:
            - ${PWD}/data:/app/data
          deploy:
            labels:
              - traefik.enable=true
              - traefik.http.routers.whatsapp_chat.middlewares=sec-headers@file
              - traefik.http.routers.whatsapp_chat.rule=Host(`chat.example.org`)
              - traefik.http.routers.whatsapp_chat.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt
              - traefik.http.routers.whatsapp_chat.tls=true
              - traefik.http.services.whatsapp_chat.loadbalancer.server.port=3000
   ```

   - We map a local `data` directory to `/app/data`, which we have configured as target for our media id database
   - Adapt the `Host` rule according to your domain.

   ```bash
      docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml whatsapp_chat
   ```

</Steps>
