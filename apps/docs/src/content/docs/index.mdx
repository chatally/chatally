ChatAlly empowers small organizations and communities to deploy their own chatbots affordably and GDPR-compliant. While there may seem to be open-source or free platforms at first glance, the quotas of free offerings are severely limited, and open-source typically only refers to the Software Development Kit (SDK). Data control usually lies with the platform providers.

While there are FOSS alternatives such as frameworks and libraries for chatbots, they are complex to set up and do not support seamless integration with popular messenger clients. With ChatAlly, our aim is to bring these components together into a plug-and-play solution that can be easily self-hosted.

## What we provide

ChatAlly is supposed to work a bit like Lego blocks.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="The base plate" icon="base">
    The ChatAlly platform is like the base plate where you start to assemble
    your chatbot from the different bricks. It also defines the shape of the
    nubs (interfaces) that the bricks have to implement to fit into the system.
  </Card>
  <Card title="The bricks" icon="brick">
    The ChatAlly module collection is a collection of bricks that you need to
    build a chatbot, e.g. for NLU (natural language understanding), STT (speech
    to text), etc. We will not implement everything ourselves, but rather wrap
    well established solutions to integrate well with the platform.
  </Card>
  <Card title="The manual" icon="manual">
    We know, that documentation is essential, that is why it is an explicit work
    package in our project and will acoount for at least half of the effort.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Examples" icon="example">
    For most people, also for us, it is easiest to understand concepts from
    examples. They also provide a good starting point for your own chatbot. That
    is, why we will provide a set of easy to deploy and understand examples.
  </Card>
  <Card title="A community" icon="community">
    Hopefully, these efforts will carry fruit and we can find an interested
    community that helps us and each other to improve the platform and the
    chatbots. We will provide a forum on Discord to facilitate this.

## Where we come from

The non-profit organization [dooiy](https://dooiy.org) provides step-by-step instructions for _good hacks, that make life easier_. Their focus audience are users in underserved communities. In this context, for a few reasons, we were looking for an easy way to distribute these instructions via WhatsApp. Only to find out, that this becomes very expensive or complicated, if you want to do it right and according to European data protection laws. Because of lack of money, we chose the difficult route and implemented our own solution that allows us, to (fairly) easily create chatbots from Markdown files. It is currently being prototyped in Mali with an instruction from [CoolVeg](https://www.coolveg.org/) for a [clay pot cooler](https://wa.me/491744899585/?text=%2Fcarl).

We proposed to the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de) to enhance this solution and make it free open-source. This is how ChatAlly was born. We are currently in the process of developing the first version of ChatAlly and are looking for contributors and users to help us make it a success.
