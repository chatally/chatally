## Sprint 1 (CW 10, Mar 4-8)

Goal: _Publish a first alpha version of the WhatsApp connector._

Rationale: As a baseline of the CI/CD process and for all future integrations, we want to extract the existing WhatsApp connector from our chatbot prototype and publish it as an NPM package within a CI/CD pipeline.

Besides that first step, setting up the website for the documentation process and all the other infrastructure is important in this sprint.
